This section explains in depth the Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol (Zama Protocol) and demonstrates how it can bring encrypted computation to smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

FHEVM is the core technology that powers the Zama Protocol. It is composed of the following key components.


FHEVM Solidity library: Enables developers to write confidential smart contracts in plain Solidity using encrypted data types and operations.
